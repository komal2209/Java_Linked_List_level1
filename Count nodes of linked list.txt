Count nodes of linked list
Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 5
Explanation: Count of nodes in the 
linked list is 5, which is its length.
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList: 2->4->6->7->5->1->0
Output: 7
Explanation: Count of nodes in the
linked list is 7. Hence, the output
is 7.
